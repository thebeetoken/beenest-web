    <p>Why do we do this? We’re not like everyone else. Beenest is unique in that, rather than tack on a laundry list of fees to guests’ bills only at the time of booking (or even after), Beenest aims to increase transparency in travel and provide all costs up front.</p>

    <h3>iCal Urls</h3>
    <p>To avoid double bookings and to prevent multiple guests from booking the same dates, sync your Beenest calendar with your other calendars and input your iCal URL from other booking platforms.</p>
    <p>Instructions to export calendars on other platforms are generally:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <span>Host</span> and select <span>Calendar</span></li>
      <li>Click <span>Availability</span> settings in your calendar view</li>
      <li>Under Sync calendars, select <span>Export Calendar</span></li>
      <li>Copy and paste the calendar link into Beenest</li>
